There is no real-time platform which can solve the hunger of the righful people. 

# Idea:
1) Create an anonymous map of people around the world who need food
2) Users can anonymously donate food from food delivery companies
3) People who requested food will be given an option to select the food
4) The platform would need integration with food delivery companies for the Platform to work

# Request from Developers
